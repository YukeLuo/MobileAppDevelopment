# MobileAppDevelopment
An App that cares about your emotion and interaction with you after your signing up and login
Built the mobile app based on kivy package in Visual Studio Code in Python. Created different user interface pages including user login/login success page, user sign up/sign up success page, and the main app page. Enabled users to sign up and stored the login information in the json database. Enabled users to interact with the app and get feedback after the interactions in the app. Used Virtual Box and ubuntu to perform the Linux operating system and created the APK file for Android phone to download this App.
